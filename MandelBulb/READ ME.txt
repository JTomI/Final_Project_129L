Before you can run this program, there is additional software that you must install.
This program is intended to be run on a Linux operating system. 

Enter terminal.
Type 'pip install tqdm' or 'pip3 install tqdm' if the first one doesn't work. 
Type 'pip install scipy'.
If you do not have pip installed, you might want to reinstall the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ as pip will then be installed on your OS. 
For more information on pip, go to https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/.

Now all of the required packages should be installed.

The only other software that this program uses is ffmpeg, which is non-python software that allows us to create an mp4 movie. 
If you intend to run this program on a Linux/Raspberry Pi system, there is a chance that ffmpeg is already installed.
Otherwise, you can install ffmpeg from https://www.ffmpeg.org/.

This is all that should be needed to get this program running. We hope you enjoy!
